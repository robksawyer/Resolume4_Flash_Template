> Resolume requires this for proper Flash playback.

Resolume highly recommends using the ActionScript 3 version of the Resolume Flash Communication API. You'll find it with examples in <./resolumeAndFlashAS3/>

If you have to use ActionScript 2 then checkout the examples in <./resolumeAndFlashAS2/>
